# Votetastic, make your voting fantastic

This is a project led by Simon Grimm.

He is actively working on this project during livestreams on
his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/SimonGrimmDev),
as well as his [Twitch Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/captainionic), where he interacts with the community in different
ways.

Simon is streaming every Thursday 15:00 (3p.m.) CET (Central European Time). Come and join us in helping him develop
this app!

## Overall description

We (the community and Simon) are making an app where everyone can vote for future projects,
that Simon should cover in his videos and livestreams.

## Technologies

We are using Angular 14 as our frontend Framework, together with Tailwind(-UI).
We are using Supabase as our BaaS where we store all data.

## Implementation

The work is uploaded to [Git](https://github.com/saimon24/Votetastic) and the WIP is deployed
on [Netlify](https://classy-kitsune-3f9088.netlify.app/).
You can use the dummy account on the app to test it out yourself!
